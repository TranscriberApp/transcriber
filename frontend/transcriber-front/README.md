## Transcriber - ML-Based Live audio transcription


### Main idea
Even though life seems to be slowly returning to normality for most of us, after the COVID pandemic. However, a grand majority of “meetings” 
such as public forums or even cultural events like theatre face the challenge of going remote. For us, joining a live theatre session or debate 
is as simple as joining a video call. However, if you look at the crowd with auditory impairment, this trivial task is no longer as trivial.

The platform offers webinar-style meetings, where one main host broadcasts audio and video to the participants whilst they interact via a 
real-time chat private to that meeting, for example when asking questions. The platform provides a live transcript generation service by using the presenter’s 
audio stream to make inferences on a deep learning engine powered by the mozilla DeepSpeech library. The model supports only english for now but it can be 
trained for any language, like Polish.
